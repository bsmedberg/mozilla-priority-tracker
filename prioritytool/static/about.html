    <p>This tool is a way to track and prioritize work:
    <ul>
      <li>Drag and drop items to reprioritize and move them between boxes.
      <li>Click on an empty cell to add a new item.
    </ul>

    <p>Each column is managed by a tech lead. To add work to somebody else's
      area, add it in the bottom "Untriaged" section. In general, the tech lead
      for an area is responsible for making all other changes within a column.

    <p>The following features are planned but not yet implemented:
    <ul>
      <li>Bugzilla sync: when bugs are assigned or fixed, the plan is to
        automatically move them into the review/uplift/complete sections.
      <li>Simultaneous update: currently if multiple people make changes
        simultaneously, there is no visual clue.
    </ul>

    <p>Details:
